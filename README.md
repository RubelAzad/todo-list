<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Youâ€™re tasked with building a simple web-based application that allows users to create and manage to-do lists. The application should be built using the Laravel framework and MySQL database.

Here's why:
* Any Users should be able to create an account and log in to the application
* Once logged in, users should be able to create, view, edit, and delete to-do lists
* Each to-do list should have a name and a list of tasks associated with it
* Users should be able to add, view, edit, and delete tasks within each to-do list

Logged-in users easily manage their own task list and see pending tasks and completed tasks!
